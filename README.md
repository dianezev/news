### A news app that uses RESTful APIs to get stories and links from various news organizations ###


#### by Diane Zevenbergen (dianezev@gmail.com) ####

Still to be done:
1. Revise code to follow MVC pattern.
2. Add TOC to css file and clean up order of content.
3. Add custom API calls for remaining news organizations.
4. Revise UI display for each org, based on JSON object returned.
5. Revise NPR section to take advantage of newer NPROne Dev Center options.



This application enables users to choose from one of several news organizations and obtain a current list of news stories or links.

Each organization makes varied formats of stories available through APIs.

The purpose of this project was to use NodeJS to implement RESTful APIs. This project utilizes the following technologies:

	* NodeJS/npm
	* Express
    * JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, HTML
	* Bootstrap 4
	* Github
