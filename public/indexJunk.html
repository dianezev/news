          <div class="hide detail">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Russia probe, led by special counsel Robert Mueller, was chosen as the top political story of the year.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It narrowly beat out the sweeping story of fallout from sexual harassment, which touched on every industry, caused the resignations of a senator and members of Congress and continues.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection happened through Twitter, where more than 4,700 users voted on the final matchup of a March Madness-style 64-story tournament.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final four included the Women's March and the firing of James Comey, the former FBI director. It was a clear indication of what readers saw as the two big thematic stories of the year — Russia and women/sexual harassment.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in the end, it was the Russia probe that won out. It has ensnared four people who worked on the Trump campaign, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and national security adviser Michael Flynn.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, far less than he could have been charged with. But Flynn got a better deal because he is cooperating with the investigation, which could indicate Mueller is climbing even higher up the ladder of Trump's inner circle.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mueller's tenure has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/12/23/572668362/the-russia-investigations-battle-lines-drawn-over-mueller-justice-dept-and-the-f" target="_blank">come under sharp criticism </a>from conservatives and allies of President Trump looking to discredit the investigation. It's sure to be a closely watched and consequential story in 2018.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 285 bracket submissions from users. And one man won out — Dave Steadman (@davesteadman). (He wins NPR <em>Morning Edition</em> host David Greene's voice on his voicemail.) Here's Dave's bracket:</p>

              <p>FACT CHECK: Where Roy Moore's Voter Fraud Claims Fall Flat</p>

          <div class="hide detail">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it to say, Roy Moore just can't let it go.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than two weeks after the Alabama Republican Senate nominee lost the state's special election to Democrat Doug Jones by about 20,000 votes, Moore not only has yet to concede but filed a lawsuit alleging voter fraud — just hours before the election was set to be certified.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday, a judge rejected the lawsuit. The certification of Jones as the winner went on as planned. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore's defiance shouldn't come as a surprise. He resisted entreaties by national Republicans to exit the race after the contest was roiled by accusations from multiple women who say Moore sexually assaulted or pursued them romantically when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On election night, Moore did not admit defeat. Days later, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/14/roy-moore-issues-fiery-video-refusing-to-concede-immorality-sweeps-over-our-land" target="_blank">issued a video</a> bemoaning "immorality [that] sweeps over our land." The former Alabama state Supreme Court chief justice — who was removed from the bench twice — and outspoken Christian nationalist also railed against "abortion, sodomy and materialism."</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore laid out his grievances, asking for a new election to be ordered. But his effort failed. That might be because there are several problems and factual errors with his claims — that even Republicans are sounding off against.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Claim No. 1: "The reported results were contrary to most of the impartial independent polls conducted prior to the special election and in contrast to exit polls." </strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, the Alabama pre-election polls were all over the place. Think your candidate was ahead? There was a poll for that! As the <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2017/senate/al/alabama_senate_special_election_moore_vs_jones-6271.html" target="_blank">RealClearPolitics poll archive shows</a>, the final polls showed a swing anywhere from Jones up 10 points to Moore up 9.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pollsters were flummoxed by exactly how to model such an unpredictable election, where turnout, given the scandal that had enveloped the final month of the race, was such a big question mark.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alabamas-senate-polls-are-all-over-the-place-heres-why_us_5a2ef06be4b01598ac473abc" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a>'s Ariel Edwards-Levy wrote:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Alabama race is a case study in nearly everything that makes horserace polling tricky. Its mid-December date, and the fact that there's nothing else on the ballot, means pollsters have relatively little data to guide their assumptions about who'll turn out to vote. The flurry of sexual misconduct allegations surrounding Moore, and the shifting reactions of national and state Republicans ― the party's national committee pulled funding for the race, but then reinstated it ― complicate things further."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus, polls aren't a justification or an exact predictor of how an election is going to turn out. As President Trump likes to frequently remind people, if the 2016 polls had been right, Hillary Clinton would be president right now.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for exit polls, those did show a surge of black voters, especially women and younger voters — all of whom are key Democratic constituencies. The black turnout was essentially what President Obama got in the state, a striking mark given that this was an off-year special election as compared with a presidential election. And about 21 percent of moderate or liberal Republicans crossed over to vote for Jones rather than Moore, likely swayed by the sexual assault allegations against him.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Claim No. 2: "Statistical analyses by election-fraud experts of the Dec. 12, 2017 results ... clearly indicate election fraud." </strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore's campaign included affidavits from what it called "three national Election Integrity experts [who] reached the same independent conclusion: 'with a reasonable degree of statistical and mathematical certainty ... election fraud occurred.' "</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard Charnin, one of those so-called experts, is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose blog contains sections about the John F. Kennedy assassination and claims that Trump won the popular vote in the 2016 election — even though he in fact lost it by almost 3 million votes.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even J. Christian Adams, a GOP lawyer and president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, who sits on Trump's voter-fraud commission and is often outspoken about concerns about voter fraud, called Moore's lawsuit and the inclusion of Charnin as an expert a farce.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charnin's analysis zeroes in on precincts in Jefferson County, which he claims have enough irregularities to reverse the election, and "calculates the probability of the election results in these precincts happening naturally is 'less than one in 15 billion.' "</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jefferson County is where Birmingham is located and, according to the Census Bureau, is 43 percent African-American. Moore is alleging that there was higher-than-usual turnout in some precincts and that typical Republican voters dropped off. But that assumes GOP voters would fall behind Moore in lockstep, and clearly they did not given the multiple allegations against him.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald, a turnout expert who runs the U.S. Elections Project, found that the discrepancies Moore's campaign claims occurred in swing precincts — just where you'd expect there to be decisive votes cast.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Claim No. 3: "Defendant should delay any certification until a meaningful investigation into the above-alleged instances of voter fraud has been completed."</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore's complaint lays out multiple allegations of voting irregularities, including sample ballots that had been marked for Jones, and claims that out-of-state residents had voted in the election and voters tried to cast more than one ballot.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill — a Republican who supported Moore — told NPR's <em>Here &amp; Now</em> on Thursday that the four most serious allegations "have all been vetted and all been cleared" by his office and "there was no fraud in those particular instances."</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, Merrill said his campaign had received just over 100 complaints, with 60 already adjudicated and 40 still under investigation. Merrill added that there was no truth to claims of fraud in a town that turned out to be fictitious, that five busloads of African-Americans from Mississippi voted or that three vanloads of Mexicans voted in the election.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merrill also said his office tracked down one man who claimed in a video that he came from another state to vote and that the man was discovered to be an Alabama resident. Merrill's office also <a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/12/sample_ballots_marked_for_doug.html" target="_blank">looked at the marked sample ballots</a> and said it was a "closed matter." And these were sample ballots anyway — not real ballots.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal filing also includes an article from the pro-Moore conservative Breitbart News, run by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who campaigned for Moore. It is about alleged intimidation tactics by Highway 31, a Democratic superPAC. Highway 31 ran a YouTube ad claiming Alabamians' votes would be public record and that neighbors would know if they voted for a "child predator."</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merrill's office <a href="http://sos.alabama.gov/newsroom/secretary-state-john-h-merrill-provides-clarification-straight-ticket-voting" target="_blank">addressed the ad</a> before Election Day, clarifying that:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote><p></p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When voters cast a ballot the State of Alabama's voter registration system is updated to document the election that a voter participated in but no record is ever made documenting the candidate for whom the ballot was cast. ... We have communicated with the individual(s) that created the video and have expressed to them the misinterpretations presented in this political commercial. Monday, the PAC responded to the Office and indicated they would not amend nor take out any of the information in the ad."</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore's campaign also included Internet comments on the article, in which commenters say, for example: "the leftists may soon find out how much lead there is in Red State America" — an apparent reference to bullets and guns.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Claim No. 4: "Moreover, Plaintiff Roy Moore has successfully completed a polygraph test confirming that the representations of misconduct made against him during the campaign are completely false." </strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that one may wonder is why Moore didn't take a polygraph <em>before</em> Election Day instead of after.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an interview on CNN Thursday, even Moore spokeswoman Janet Porter conceded that might have been more effective. Moore included his own affidavit saying he passed the polygraph, noting: "As I had expected, the results of the examination reflected that I did not know, nor had I ever had any sexual contact with any of these individuals."</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no report provided from the polygraph administrator, no notes about how questions were asked or even who conducted it. There is much debate over accurate polygraph tests can be, anyway, and they aren't admissible in court in most instances.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can often produce inaccurate results, <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15670581" target="_blank">as NPR reported in 2007</a>:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Herein lies the rub. While the polygraph can show when someone gets anxious, it can't say definitively what is triggering their anxiety. Critics of the machine say it is as much about intimidation as it is about not telling the truth."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, the National Academy of Sciences decided to put the machine to the test. Its conclusion: When the polygraph was used to investigate a specific incident, it performed "well above chance though well below perfection."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was hardly a ringing endorsement. The problem, the academy's report said, was that while the physical manifestations often associated with lying could be measured by the polygraph, the very same problems — increased heart rate, skyrocketing blood pressure and sweaty palms — could happen in the absence of a lie as well.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, none of these are evidence of fraud, but it is perhaps not surprising that Moore is trying this. After all, it's ripped right from Trump's playbook. Trump claims voter fraud caused him to lose the popular vote — by 3 million votes — with no evidence. So, what's claiming 20,000?  </p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fallout from sexual harassment, former FBI Director James Comey's firing and the ensuing Russia probe by special counsel Robert Mueller are all in strong positions to be the top political stories of 2017.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there be an upset Thursday? Voting begins at 8:30 a.m. ET and will close at noon ET, when voting will begin on the final eight. (<a href="https://twitter.com/DomenicoNPR" target="_blank">VOTE HERE!</a>)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Round 2 voting of the NPR Top Political Story of the Year Bracket, voters on Twitter advanced top seeds easily and delivered an upset — 6-seed Travel Ban over No. 3 Gutting Obamacare, 53-47.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another close contest, 3-seed Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch's appointment narrowly beat out No. 6 North Korea missile tests and Trump calling Kim Jong Un "Rocket Man," 51-49.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, perhaps surprisingly, two 5-seeds beat No. 4s — Arizona Sen. John McCain's Thumbs-Down health care vote trounced No. 4 Trump vs. the NFL and black athletes, 59-41; and Doug Jones' Alabama Win narrowly defeated the End of Net-Neutrality, 51-49.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's the bracket: <a href="https://twitter.com/DomenicoNPR" target="_blank">(VOTE HERE!)</a></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>What to watch Thursday</strong></h3><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a big day Thursday, as <a href="https://twitter.com/DomenicoNPR" target="_blank">voting continues on Twitter</a>. Readers will have a chance to vote on two round. By the end of the day, we will know the final four teams. The winner will be announced Friday afternoon.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key matchups:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>1. Trump inauguration vs. the Women's March: </strong>Trump inauguration has performed as the weakest 1 seed so far. It defeated the controversy of Trump vs. Gold Star Mom 68-32. The other 1 seeds finished with at least 87 percent in both rounds.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>2. The fallout over sexual harassment and the Mueller Probe </strong>have emerged as the two to beat.<strong> </strong>Neither has gotten less than 96 percent of votes in the first two rounds.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>3. </strong>The winner of Inauguration vs. March takes on the winner of <strong>No. 3 Natural Disasters </strong>and<strong> Undermining of Democratic Institutions</strong>, which breezed in Round 2.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>4. Mueller appears poised to move on again</strong>, taking on McCain's Thumbs-Down. The winner of that match takes on whoever emerges out of what could be a close contest in Travel Ban vs. Charlottesville.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>5. Sexual Harassment Fallout appears to be in a strong position </strong>going up against Doug Jones in a contest that pits the story with the widest reach of the year against the top electoral political story of the year.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>6. </strong>The winner there takes on the winner of a tough-to-decide matchup between a <strong>Year of Gun Violence </strong>and<strong> "Alternative Facts."</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>7. </strong>In the lower right bracket, <strong>Comey's firing takes on the Paris Climate Deal Withdrawal</strong>, a story that has shown surprising strength crushing two solid stories so far.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>8. </strong>The Comey-Paris winner takes on whoever emerges out of <strong>Gorsuch </strong>vs.<strong> the Tax Overhaul. </strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some good contests Thursday. You can vote here.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>NOTES: </strong>After the first round, there were two perfect brackets from Persistent Voter (<a href="https://twitter.com/VMurphy1787" target="_blank">@<strong>VMurphy1787</strong></a>) and Parker Ashford (<a href="https://twitter.com/parkerashford" target="_blank">@<strong>parkerashford</strong></a>). Kudos! Amazing accomplishment out of 285 brackets submitted. But there are no more perfect brackets after Round 2. Both missed some matchups.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a pretty predictable first round of voting in the NPR Top Political Story of the Year Bracket.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top seeds all advanced easily. The only upset was 10-seeded Anthony Scaramucci's 10 days in the White House breezing past the far-more important New York Truck Attack, which was a 7-seed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But "The Mooch's" staying power in the bracket might turn out similarly to his stay in the White House — make a splash, but short-lived. That's because he's up against the 2-seed Charlottesville violence in the next round. (Charlottesville advanced easily, 97-3, over Majority GOP Support for marijuana legalization, a first.)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one tie by percentage, No. 7 TPP torn up vs. No. 10 Trump says "Pocahontas" in front of Navajo Code Talkers. It turned out 50-50, but there was an odd number of votes, and Twitter says TPP won (though we were unable to see raw-vote totals.)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voting commences again at noon.

And it's against a strong 9 seed Wednesday, Trump vs. Gold Star Mom. It did quite well, beating out No. 8 Priebus Out of White House, 64-36.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some other possible close ones:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>5 Deportations/DACA vs. 4 Women's March<br>5 McCain thumbs down vs. 4 Trump vs. NFL/black athletes<br>6 Travel ban vs. 3 Gutting Obamacare<br>5 Doug Jones' win vs. 4 The End of Net-Neutrality<br>6 Donald Trump Jr's email revelations vs. 3 Gun violence<br>7 Transgender ban vs. "Alternative Facts"<br>6 North Korea missile tests/"Rocket Man" vs. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court</strong>  </p><div class="fullattribution">Copyright 2017 NPR.
